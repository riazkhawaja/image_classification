Image classification demo made with PyTorch.  
```images``` folder will contain the images, and ```labels/labels.csv``` will contain the labels for images. The class names are in ```labels/classes.csv```  
To use inference, place test images in ```inputs``` and pass the name of the image and it's actual label to the script.
